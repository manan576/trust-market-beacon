**Live Demo**: [https://trustmart-team-codecraft.vercel.app/](https://trustmart-team-codecraft.vercel.app/)

## Project Description

Trust Mart is an innovative e-commerce platform that revolutionizes online shopping by implementing **AI-powered trust scoring systems** for both customers and merchants. In today's digital marketplace, fake reviews and unreliable sellers are major concerns. Trust Mart addresses these issues by:

- **Customer Credibility Scoring**: Using machine learning to analyze customer behavior, purchase history, and review patterns to assign credibility scores
- **Merchant Trust Scoring**: Evaluating merchants based on delivery performance, product quality, customer service, and authenticity metrics
- **Real-time Score Updates**: Dynamic scoring that reflects current behavior and maintains marketplace integrity
- **Transparent Trust System**: Customers can see credibility scores on all reviews and merchant ratings on all products

This creates a more trustworthy shopping environment where genuine reviews are highlighted and reliable merchants are rewarded.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Dynamic Product Catalog**: Browse products across multiple categories with real-time pricing from different merchants
- **AI-Powered Customer Credibility**: Machine learning model evaluates customer trustworthiness based on:
  - Purchase history and value
  - Review authenticity and sentiment
  - Account tenure and verification status
  - Star rating patterns
- **Merchant Trust Scoring**: Comprehensive merchant evaluation including:
  - Quality metrics (return rates, defect rates, authenticity)
  - Delivery performance (on-time delivery, shipping accuracy)
  - Customer service (response time, query resolution, satisfaction)
  - Review authenticity and sentiment analysis
- **Real-time Review System**: Submit reviews with automatic credibility score updates
- **Admin Management Pages**:
  - `/customer-management`: Simulate and test customer parameter updates to see credibility score changes
  - `/merchant-management`: Adjust merchant parameters to update trust scores across all their products
- **Verified Purchase Integration**: Purchase value automatically updates customer credibility when reviews are verified
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes with modern UI/UX

## üéØ How Scoring Systems Work

### Customer Credibility Score Updates
1. **Automatic Updates**: Every time a customer submits a review, their credibility score is automatically recalculated
2. **ML Model Input**: The system sends the following data to the ML API:
   - Review text content
   - Star rating given
   - Verified purchase status (0 or 1)
   - Customer tenure in months
   - Total purchase value in rupees
3. **Score Calculation**: The ML model returns a credibility score (0-100) based on behavior patterns
4. **Database Update**: The new score is stored in the customers table and displayed on all past and future reviews
5. **Purchase Value Increment**: For verified purchases, the customer's total purchase value increases by the product price

### Merchant Trust Score Updates
1. **Parameter Management**: Admins can update merchant parameters via `/merchant-management`
2. **ML Model Factors**: The system evaluates 16+ parameters including:
   - Quality metrics (return rates, defect rates, authenticity scores)
   - Delivery performance (on-time delivery, shipping accuracy)
   - Customer service (response time, satisfaction scores)
   - Review patterns (sentiment, authenticity, positive ratios)
3. **Real-time Updates**: Changes to parameters immediately trigger score recalculation
4. **Trust Tag Assignment**: Merchants receive tags (Excellent, Good, Moderate) based on their scores
5. **Cross-Product Impact**: Updated scores appear on all products sold by the merchant
